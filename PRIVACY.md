# Privacy Policy – INR Name Resolver

Last updated: 2026-01-16

This privacy policy applies specifically to the **INR Name Resolver** browser extension (the “Extension”), published by **PandaByte** (“we”, “us”).

For our general website privacy policy, please see: https://pandabyte.net/privacy

## 1. Single purpose
The Extension’s single purpose is to **resolve “.iota” names** in the browser and **display the resolution details** (e.g., records and raw JSON) to the user. If the user enables it, the Extension can optionally perform an automatic redirect for “.iota” navigations.

## 2. Data the Extension processes
The Extension is designed to minimize data handling. It does **not** request or collect account credentials, names, email addresses, or payment information.

The Extension may process the following categories of data solely to provide its functionality:

- **User settings (local only):** Preferences such as the selected network/RPC endpoint and whether auto-redirect is enabled.
- **Resolution queries:** The “.iota” name the user is resolving and the corresponding resolution results returned by the configured endpoint.

## 3. How data is used
The Extension uses the data above only to:

- resolve “.iota” names and display results in the Extension UI; and
- remember user preferences between sessions.

## 4. Data sharing and third parties
We do not sell or rent user data.

If the Extension is configured to query a remote resolver/RPC endpoint, the Extension sends the minimum necessary request to that endpoint to retrieve resolution data. As with any network request, the endpoint may receive technical information such as the user’s IP address and standard request metadata. The Extension does not add tracking identifiers and does not transmit additional browsing content beyond what is necessary to perform the resolution.

## 5. Storage and retention
User settings are stored locally using the browser’s extension storage and remain until the user changes them, clears extension data, or uninstalls the Extension.

## 6. Security
We aim to reduce permissions and handle data in a least-privilege manner. Where applicable, the Extension uses secure connections (HTTPS) for remote requests.

## 7. User choices
Users can:

- disable optional features (such as auto-redirect) in the Extension settings;
- remove stored settings by clearing extension data or uninstalling the Extension.

## 8. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date above indicates the latest revision.
