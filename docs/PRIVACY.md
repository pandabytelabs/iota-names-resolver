INR Name Resolver resolves “.iota” names in the browser and displays resolution details. Optional auto-redirect only applies when enabled by the user.

## Data processing
- Local settings (e.g., endpoint, auto-redirect preference)
- Resolution queries (“.iota” name) and returned resolution results

## Sharing
No sale or rental of user data. Remote endpoint requests may expose IP/request metadata to that endpoint as with any web request.
